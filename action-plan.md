I'll analyze the demo plan and your current components to create a detailed implementation plan. Let me first examine the current state of each component to understand what we have and what needs to be built.

Now let me examine the current implementation status of each component to understand what's already built:


[5 tools called]

Based on my analysis of the demo plan and current codebase, here's my detailed implementation plan to achieve the full production flow:

## **ViWorkS Production Implementation Plan**

### **Current State Analysis**

**✅ What's Already Built:**
1. **Backend**: Basic Rust API with database schema, authentication, and OTP system
2. **Frontend**: Next.js admin panel with UI components and sections
3. **macOS Client**: Egui-based desktop application structure
4. **Android App**: Basic Kotlin app with navigation and authentication
5. **Database**: PostgreSQL schema with users, sessions, OTP, policies, and audit tables

**❌ What's Missing for Production Flow:**
1. **Gateway OS Integration**: Control channel between backend and gateway
2. **Complete OTP Flow**: Mobile-to-desktop OTP verification
3. **Bootstrap Generation**: Short-lived connection credentials
4. **Tunnel Management**: SPA → TLS → OpenVPN connection flow
5. **Session Monitoring**: Real-time session tracking and termination
6. **Production Deployment**: Docker containers and orchestration

### **Implementation Priority Order**

1. **Start with Backend APIs** - Core functionality needed by all components
2. **Build Frontend Admin Panel** - Required for user management and monitoring
3. **Develop macOS Client** - Primary user interface for end users
4. **Complete Android App** - Critical for 2FA authentication
5. **Integrate Gateway** - Infrastructure layer for secure access
6. **Deploy to Production** - Containerization and environment setup
7. **Test and Validate** - Ensure everything works as designed

---

### **Key Success Criteria**

✅ **User can be provisioned in all three systems (Directory, VPN/SPA, Panel)**
✅ **Desktop login triggers mobile OTP, user enters code, gets bootstrap**
✅ **Tunnel connects successfully, published Chrome opens**
✅ **Admin sees active session, can monitor and terminate**
✅ **Session termination works within 10 seconds**
✅ **All security requirements are met (no persistent secrets, rate limiting, audit)**

This plan follows the exact flow described in your demo plan and builds upon the existing codebase. Each phase is designed to be completed in approximately one week, with clear deliverables and acceptance criteria.

Would you like me to start with Phase 1 (Core Backend APIs) and begin implementing the user provisioning and enhanced authentication flow?
