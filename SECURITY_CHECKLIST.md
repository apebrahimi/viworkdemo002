## üìã **QUICK SECURITY STATUS**

### **Current Production Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Docker Images:** 0 vulnerabilities (Trivy scan)
- ‚úÖ **Node.js Dependencies:** 0 vulnerabilities (pnpm audit)
- ‚úÖ **Rust Dependencies:** 0 vulnerabilities (cargo audit)
- ‚úÖ **Containers:** All healthy and running
- ‚úÖ **Network:** Localhost-only binding for security

---

## üöÄ **AUTOMATED SECURITY CHECKS**

### **1. Dependency Security Audit**
```bash
# Run the comprehensive audit script
./scripts/project_audit.sh

# Or run individual audits
make audit-node    # Node.js security
make audit-rust    # Rust security  
make audit-docker  # Docker image security
```

### **2. Docker Security Scan**
```bash
# Scan all production images
trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL viworks/backend:prod
trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL backup-frontend-prod:latest
trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL postgres:17-alpine
trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL redis:8.2.1-alpine

# Full vulnerability scan
trivy image --severity LOW,MEDIUM,HIGH,CRITICAL viworks/backend:prod
```

### **3. Container Health Check**
```bash
# Check container status
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Image}}"

# Check container logs for errors
docker logs viworks-backend-prod --tail 50
docker logs viworks-frontend-prod --tail 50
```

## üß™ **SECURITY TESTING**

### **9. Penetration Testing**
```bash
# Test authentication endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"wrong_password"}'

# Test authorization
curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/admin/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer INVALID_TOKEN"

# Test SQL injection
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"'\'' OR 1=1--"}'
```

### **10. Load Testing**
```bash
# Install and run load testing
npm install -g artillery
artillery quick --count 100 --num 10 http://localhost:3000
artillery quick --count 100 --num 10 http://localhost:8081/health
```

### **11. API Security Testing**
```bash
# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/auth/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"username":"test","password":"test"}'
done

# Test CORS
curl -H "Origin: http://malicious-site.com" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-Requested-With" \
  -X OPTIONS http://localhost:8081/api/users
```
