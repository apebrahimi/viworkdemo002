# 🎉 Standalone Nginx Deployment Success Report

## ✅ Problem Solved

The issue where `http://website-vw.neuratalent.com` was showing "Access Denied" admin panel page has been **completely resolved**!

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Standalone Nginx Container
- **Image**: Official `nginx:alpine` from Docker Hub
- **Purpose**: Acts as a reverse proxy for all ViWorks services
- **Network**: Connected to `viworks-network` to access all containers

### 2. Proper Domain Routing
- `website-vw.neuratalent.com` → `viworkswebsite:3000` ✅
- `admin-viworks.neuratalent.com` → `viworks-frontend:3000` ✅
- `viworks.neuratalent.com` → `viworks-frontend:3000` ✅

### 3. Container Network Configuration
- All containers connected to `viworks-network`
- Standalone nginx can resolve container names
- Proper upstream definitions for each service
