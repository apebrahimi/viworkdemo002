## Implementation Priority Order

1. **Gateway OS Agent** - Critical infrastructure component
2. **Backend API Enhancement** - Core functionality needed by all components
3. **Frontend Admin Panel** - Required for user management and monitoring
4. **macOS Desktop Client** - Primary user interface for end users
5. **Android Authenticator** - Critical for 2FA authentication

---

## Key Success Criteria

✅ **User can be provisioned in all three systems (Directory, VPN/SPA, Panel)**
✅ **Desktop login triggers mobile OTP, user enters code, gets bootstrap**
✅ **Tunnel connects successfully, published Chrome opens**
✅ **Admin sees active session, can monitor and terminate**
✅ **Session termination works within 10 seconds**
✅ **All security requirements are met (no persistent secrets, rate limiting, audit)**

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Agent Security**: Implement strict allowlisting and audit logging
2. **OTP Flow**: Ensure proper rate limiting and security measures
3. **Bootstrap Security**: Keep credentials ephemeral and time-boxed
4. **Session Management**: Implement proper cleanup and monitoring

### Contingency Plans
1. **Agent Failure**: Implement health checks and automatic restart
2. **Backend Outage**: Add graceful degradation and recovery
3. **Mobile App Issues**: Provide fallback OTP delivery methods
4. **Network Issues**: Implement retry logic and circuit breakers

## Timeline Summary

- **Week 1**: Gateway OS Agent Development
- **Week 2**: Backend API Enhancement
- **Week 3**: Frontend Admin Panel
- **Week 4**: macOS Desktop Client
- **Week 5**: Android Authenticator
- **Week 6**: Production Deployment
- **Week 7**: Testing and Validation

**Total Duration**: 7 weeks
**Critical Path**: Agent → Backend → Frontend → Clients → Deployment → Testing

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Gateway OS Agent** - This is the foundation for all other components
2. **Create detailed agent specification** - Define exact commands and protocols
3. **Begin agent implementation** - Start with core security and communication
4. **Plan agent deployment** - How to securely deploy and manage the agent

The agent is the critical missing piece that enables the entire system to work. Once the agent is complete, we can proceed with the backend integration and then build the other components on top of this foundation.
