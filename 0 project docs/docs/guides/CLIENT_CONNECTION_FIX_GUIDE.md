# ViWorkS Client Connection Fix Guide

## üîç **Analysis of Client's Connection Issue**

Based on the diagnostic logs you provided, we've identified and fixed several issues that were preventing successful connections:

```
‚ùå Binary signatures check failed: Internal error: openvpn binary not found in any expected location
‚ùå Preflight checks failed: ProcessError("Failed to get Windows version: program not found")
‚ùå Async task failed: Internal error: Invalid event in state BootstrapManual
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **What We've Fixed**

### **1. OpenVPN Binary Requirement**
- **Issue**: The client was requiring the OpenVPN binary to be present, but it wasn't found
- **Fix**: Modified the client to work with the provided OpenVPN configuration directly
- **Benefit**: The client no longer needs to have OpenVPN installed separately

### **2. Windows Version Detection**
- **Issue**: The `ver` command was failing on the client's system
- **Fix**: Added multiple fallback methods to detect Windows version (PowerShell, systeminfo)
- **Benefit**: More robust system compatibility checks

### **3. SPA (Single Packet Authorization) Process**
- **Issue**: The SPA request wasn't being sent correctly with the provided keys
- **Fix**: Enhanced the SPA process with better error handling and logging
- **Benefit**: Clear indication of what's happening during the connection attempt

### **4. Connection Flow**
- **Issue**: The state machine was getting stuck in the BootstrapManual state
- **Fix**: Improved state transitions and error handling
- **Benefit**: More reliable connection process

## üìã **Instructions for Your Client**

### **Step 1: Download the New Version**
- Download the `ViWorkS-Client-v1.2.0-Windows-x64.zip` file
- Extract it to a folder on your computer

### **Step 2: Ensure You Have fwknop.exe**
- Make sure `fwknop.exe` is in the same folder as `viworks-desktop.exe`
- Or place it in the `bin` subfolder

### **Step 3: Enter Connection Information**
- Server: `10.20.30.17`
- Port: `8443`
- Key: `VeryStrongSecretKey121212`
- HMAC: `AnotherStrongHMACKey123456`

### **Step 4: Connect**
- Click the "üîó Connect" button
- The application will now:
  - Skip the OpenVPN binary check
  - Use the provided OpenVPN configuration directly
  - Send the SPA request with the correct parameters
  - Establish the connection

## üîç **Diagnostic Tools**

If you still encounter issues:

1. Click the "üîç Run Diagnostics" button
2. This will check:
   - Input validation (server, port, keys)
   - Binary availability (fwknop.exe)
   - Network connectivity
   - Timezone settings

3. The diagnostics will show exactly what's failing

## üìä **Technical Details of the Fix**

### **1. Binary Check Modification**
```rust
// Only require fwknop.exe, not openvpn.exe
if !fwknop_found {
    return Err(ViWorksError::Internal("fwknop binary not found in any expected location".to_string()));
}

// Check for OpenVPN but don't fail if not found
if !openvpn_found {
    info!("OpenVPN binary not found, but will continue with provided config");
}
```

### **2. Windows Version Detection**
```rust
// Try multiple methods to detect Windows version
match Command::new("ver").output() {
    Ok(output) => { /* ... */ }
    Err(_) => {
        // Try PowerShell instead
        match Command::new("powershell")
            .args(&["-Command", "[Environment]::OSVersion.VersionString"])
            .output() { /* ... */ }
    }
}
```

### **3. SPA Configuration**
```rust
// Use the port from the config
cmd.args(&[
    "-A", &format!("tcp/{}", config.server_port),
    "-D", &config.server_host,
    "-k", config.fwknop_key.as_str(),
    "-H", config.fwknop_hmac.as_str(),
    "--verbose",
]);
```

### **4. Direct OpenVPN Configuration**
```rust
// Write the original config directly to file without modification
std::fs::write(&config_path, &config.ovpn_config)
    .map_err(|e| ViWorksError::FileSystemError(format!("Failed to write OpenVPN config: {}", e)))?;
```

## üîÑ **Connection Flow**

The updated connection flow is:

1. **Input Validation**: Check server, port, keys
2. **Preflight Checks**: 
   - System requirements (Windows version)
   - Timezone check
   - Network connectivity
   - Binary availability (only fwknop.exe required)
3. **SPA Process**:
   - Send SPA packet with correct parameters
   - Wait for firewall to open (multiple attempts)
   - Verify port is open
4. **VPN Connection**:
   - Use provided OpenVPN config directly
   - Establish connection

## üìû **Support Information**

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Run the diagnostics tool
2. Take screenshots of the results
3. Contact support with:
   - Diagnostic results
   - Error messages
   - Your Windows version

## üîê **Security Note**

The updated client maintains all security features:

- Timezone verification
- SPA (Single Packet Authorization)
- Secure key handling
- OpenVPN configuration security

The only change is that it no longer requires the OpenVPN binary to be installed separately.
