ok now that we have our client working and geneerating the tunnels 
lets improve it from different perspectives 
the first important thing is security 
we need to make sure our solution is the most solution we can offer from features and design, end we should improve our code and client to be secure from every perspective 

I need you to do a very deep analysis of our project and suggest your plan to achieve our best 

I'll perform a comprehensive security analysis of your VPN client project and provide a detailed plan to achieve the highest security standards. Let me start by examining the current codebase structure and implementation.
please proceed 

I'll continue with the security analysis and run the cargo-deny check to complete our comprehensive security assessment.
üîí Comprehensive Security Analysis & Improvement Plan for ViWorkS Client
Based on my deep analysis of your VPN client project, I've identified several critical security areas that need immediate attention and improvement. Here's my comprehensive security assessment and detailed improvement plan:
