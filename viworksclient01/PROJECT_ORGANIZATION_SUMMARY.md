## 📋 **FILE MOVEMENT SUMMARY**

### **✅ Successfully Moved**
- **PowerShell Scripts**: All `.ps1` files moved to `products/clients/windows/scripts/`
- **Binary Files**: All `.exe`, `.dll`, `.pem`, `.cnf`, `.msi` files moved to `products/clients/windows/binaries/`
- **Distribution Files**: `ViWorkS-Client-v1.0.0-Windows-x64.zip` moved to `products/clients/windows/`
- **Documentation**: All `.md` files organized into appropriate `docs/` subdirectories

### **⚠️ Files Still in Root (In Use)**
- **`.gitignore`**: Project-level Git ignore rules (should remain in root)
- **`stunnel.log`**: Active log file (cannot be moved while in use)
- **Some DLL files**: In use by running processes (cannot be removed)

---

## 🔧 **RUNTIME DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT**

### **📦 Automatic Dependency Handling**
The build scripts have been updated to automatically manage runtime dependencies:

#### **Development Builds**
- **`fast_build.ps1`**: Automatically copies dependencies to `target/debug/` or `target/release/`
- **`run_app.ps1`**: Checks and copies missing dependencies before running
- **`copy_runtime_deps.ps1`**: Manual dependency copying for troubleshooting

#### **Production Releases**
- **`release.ps1`**: Includes all runtime dependencies in distribution package
- **Distribution**: All required DLLs and executables packaged with the client

### **🔧 Required Runtime Files**
The Windows client requires these files to run properly:
- **Executables**: `fwknop.exe`, `openvpn.exe`, `stunnel.exe`
- **Libraries**: `libcrypto-3-x64.dll`, `libssl-3-x64.dll`, `libgcc_s_seh-1.dll`, `libssp-0.dll`
- **Configurations**: `ca-certs.pem`, `openssl.cnf`, `stunnel.conf`

### **📁 File Locations**
- **Source**: `products/clients/windows/binaries/` - All runtime dependencies
- **Development**: `products/clients/windows/target/debug/` or `target/release/` - Copied for testing
- **Production**: Distribution package - All files included together

## 🚀 **READY FOR DEVELOPMENT**

### **📋 Next Steps**
1. **Use the Cursor Prompt**: `CURSOR_PROJECT_CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md`
2. **Follow the Master Plan**: `docs/platform/PLATFORM_MASTER_PLAN.md`
3. **Check Progress**: `docs/platform/PLATFORM_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`
4. **Continue Development**: Phase 2 - Admin Panel Development

### **🔧 Development Workflow**
- **Navigate to specific products**: `cd products/[product-name]/`
- **Follow standard structure**: `products/shared/configs/standard-structure.md`
- **Update progress**: Always update progress tracker
- **Maintain documentation**: Keep all docs current

### **🖥️ Windows Client Testing**
```powershell
# Navigate to Windows client
cd products/clients/windows

# Build with automatic dependency copying
.\scripts\fast_build.ps1

# Run with dependency checking
.\scripts\run_app.ps1

# Create production release
.\scripts\release.ps1
```

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT NOTES**

### **⚠️ Runtime Dependencies**
- **Always use build scripts**: They automatically handle dependency copying
- **Check binaries directory**: Ensure all required files are present
- **Test thoroughly**: Verify the client runs correctly after builds
- **Production packaging**: Release script includes all dependencies

### **🔧 Build Scripts**
- **`fast_build.ps1`**: Fast development build with dependency copying
